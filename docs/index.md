# TMSVR Blog code examples

This page is about the code examples created for my blog [TMSVR.com](https://tmsvr.com).

## React leaflet interactive map examples

One topic is the Interactive leaflet map that I have created in React to learn these new technologies. This experimenting later turned into a side-project called [AtlasNinja](https://atlasninja.com). There are 2 articles on my blog about the technical aspects of creating an interactive amp in React using Leaflet:

- [Making an interactive map with React and Leaflet](https://tmsvr.com/making-an-interactive-map-with-react-and-leaflet/)
- [React interactive choropleth map - Part 2](https://tmsvr.com/react-leaflet-map-performance-issues/)

There are code examples for these articles in my git repo here: https://github.com/Timester/tmsvr-blog/tree/master/react-choropleth-map 

And a third one is about the AtlasNinja project, whic is a website providing factual information about countries ina  modern clean design.
